Sentiment Analysis (SA) is the process of using text analysis methods, natural language
processing (NLP) and computational linguistics to be able to extract, identify, and quantify the
sentiment and connotation of any given text accordingly – that is, to be able to determine
whether a string of words are conveying a positive or negative emotion, based on the context.
The applications of SA include detecting the feeling of a text, testing interest in text, or even to
test text polarity (whether a text is positive or not).

For this project, we have categorized possible sentiment values inferred from texts into 5
categories: joy, anger, fear, sadness, neutral. With the help of a pre-trained data set, we have
trained 2 different Machine Learning (ML) models to be able to predict the sentiment from input
text – a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using Keras Sequential API, and a
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model using Long short-term memory (LSTM) network. A
model was also implemented using both the CNN and LSTM layers. An SVM, and Simple
Naïve-Bayes (NB) model were implemented for comparison purposes. Below is a diagram
summarizing the workflow of our proposed method. The purpose of our project is to compare the
effectiveness of Sentiment Analysis using CNN (Keras) vs RNN (LSTM).
